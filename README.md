# HTML First Steps
This folder has projects from the beginning of my journey.

Alright, let's understand what each project is about:

  1 - ModeloAna - It is the first website I made ever. Really simple code. I was really happy when I finished it. <br/>
  2 - ProjetoBlog - My second website. More details were added to this one. <br/>
  3 - CSSIntermediarioAvancado - Just a bunch of code that I used for training. New details to use on CSS like overflow and max/min width. Working with liquid layouts, it's pretty much it. <br/>
  4 - TabelaEstilizada - A table with CSS details applied.

I will update more projects during my development process!

Thank you!
